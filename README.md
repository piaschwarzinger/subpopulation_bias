# Identifying subpopulation bias in synthetic datasets
## Bachelor thesis

NLP and especially Large Language Models have gained importance due to their promising opportunities, one of which is the generation of synthetic data. 
This repository includes GReaT which is used to generate synthetic tabular data. 
Subsequently, the Misprediction Diagnoser is applied to identify subpopulations for which the predictions are particularly bad. 
Ultimately, these rules are examined for subpopulation bias. 
For more information, please refer to my thesis. 


I express my gratitude to the HuggingFace ðŸ¤— framework.
